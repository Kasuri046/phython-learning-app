        "Line 1: #include <iostream> is a header file library that lets us work with input and output objects, such as cout (used in line 5). Header files add functionality to C++ programs.",
        "Line 2: using namespace std means that we can use names for objects and variables from the standard library.",
        "Line 3: A blank line. C++ ignores whitespace, but we use it to make the code more readable.",
        "Line 4: Another thing that always appears in a C++ program is int main(). This is called a function. Any code inside its curly brackets {} will be executed.",
        "Line 5: cout (pronounced 'see-out') is an object used together with the insertion operator (<<) to output/print text. In our example, it will output 'Hello World!'.",
        "Note: C++ is case-sensitive: 'cout' and 'Cout' have different meanings.",
        "Note: Every C++ statement ends with a semicolon ;.",
        "Note: The body of int main() could also be written as:\nint main() {\n  cout << \"Hello World!\";\n  return 0;\n}",
        "Remember: The compiler ignores whitespace. However, multiple lines make the code more readable.",
        "Line 6: return 0; ends the main function.",
        "Line 7: Do not forget to add the closing curly bracket } to actually end the main function."
