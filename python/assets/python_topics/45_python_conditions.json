      "heading": "Python Conditions and If statements",
      "description": "Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics: These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in \"if statements\" and loops. An \"if statement\" is written by using the if keyword. In this example we use two variables, a and b, which are used as part of the if statement to test whether b is greater than a. As a is 33, and b is 200, we know that 200 is greater than 33, and so we print to screen that \"b is greater than a\".",
