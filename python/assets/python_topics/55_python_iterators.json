As you have learned in the Python Classes/Objects chapter, all classes have a function called __init__(), which allows you to do some initializing when the object is being created. The __iter__() method acts similar, you can do operations (initializing etc.), but must always return the iterator object itself. The __next__() method also allows you to do operations, and must return the next item in the sequence.",
