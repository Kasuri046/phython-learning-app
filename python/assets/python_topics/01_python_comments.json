To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line: Or, not quite as intended, you can use a multiline string. Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it: As long as the string is not assigned to a variable, Python will read the code, but then ignore it, and you have made a multiline comment.",
